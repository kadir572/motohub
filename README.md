# Motohub Developer Manual

## Folder Structure

The project is divided into two main folders. The **public** folder contains all the data that the client is going to see. The **app** folder contains all the backend related files.

## Access/Navigate

The root of the application is not "/", it is "/public". So to open the application go to _http://localhost/{project-name}/public_.

## CMS

The CMS can be accessed over the route /admin.

## Email Service

For testing purposes a mail testing service is being used. Here we use [MailTrap](https://mailtrap.io/). You can log in and see mails from all accounts used in this application. Its main purpose is to be able to change the password if forgotten.
