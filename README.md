# Motohub Developer Manual

## Folder Structure

The project is divided into two main folders. The **public** folder contains all the data that the client is going to see. The **app** folder contains all the backend related files.

## Config File Location

Path: {rootDirectory}/app/core/config.php

## CMS

The CMS can be accessed over the route /admin.

## Email Service

Used for:
Contact Form:&emsp;{ROOT}/public/home/contact
Password Reset:&emsp;{ROOT}/public/resetpwd

For testing purposes a mail testing service is being used. Here we use [MailTrap](https://mailtrap.io/). You can log in and see mails from all accounts used in this application. Its main purpose is to be able to change the password if forgotten.
